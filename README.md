# Credential Manager App

## What is it?

It's an application that allows you quickly encrypt and/or decrypt sensitive text with a click of a button.  All you have to do is specify a X509 certificate file or choose from one that's installed into your Personal certificate store.

The reason for the name "Credential Manager App" is that I personally use this application for encrypting website passwords and usernames for safe storage.

## How does it work?

By selecting a encryption certificate from a certificate file...

... or choosing from an already installed certificate on your PC...

...typing in a username and/or password in the provided fields, and clicking the **ENCRYPT/DECRYPT** button.
